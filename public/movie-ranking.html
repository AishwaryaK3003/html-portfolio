<h1>My Favourite Run BTS Episodes</h1>
<h2>My top 3 episodes of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Episode 100</h3>
<p>This is where they celebrated their 100th episode by playing their best games played so far.</p>

<h3>Episode 33</h3>
<p>This is one of the first episodes I wtched where they were playing the headphone game. Lachimilala was the best part and Seokjin's intelligent and handsome face was een too. Jungkook was very cute in this episode.</p>

<h3>Episode 132</h3>
<p>The funniest debate competion amongst the teams I have seen ever. The way they get splashed over by the water. Jungkook's fun side pranking all the members. Jhopes famous WOW meme face was generated from this episode.</p>
